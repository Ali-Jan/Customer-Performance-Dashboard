# Customer Performance Dashboard

This project uses Adventure Works DW sales data to analyze customer performance.

## Objectives:

The objective of this project is to make a Dashboard where it must achieve the following objectives.

- Calculate the **Average Age** of the customers.
- Determine the **Total Count** of the customers.
- Implement a **Dynamic Ranking System** to identify the top-performing customers.
- Analyze Revenue based on  **Customers With Children or Without Children**.
- Examine Revenue based on Customer's **Age Group**.
- **Categorize Customers** based on their total orders and purchases.
	- **VIP Customers** - Having Total Orders >= 2 and Total Purchases >= 100
	- **Loyal Customers** - Having Total Orders >=2
	- **Periodic Customers** - Others
- Examine Revenue based on **Customer Gender**.



## Implementation:
Here I will explain how the project was implemented with actual DAX codes. But before I am going to share the result with the additional feature of **Dark and Light Themes**

#### Dark Theme:

#### Light Theme:

The above pictures clearly show the dashboard has achieved the objectives that were set before.

I will now share each part of the dashboard with its corresponding Measures and Columns created via DAX.

#### Part 1:

This Part of the dashboard is aligned with the first and 2nd objectives of the Project.

Here I have created a new measure namely average age with the following DAX code and displayed it using a card.

The Total Customers is also calculated and displayed the same way with the below DAX code.

#### Part 2:

Here I have implemented the third objective of the Project.

First, I have created new parameter namely **Dynamic** via 
**Modeling tab --> New Parameter --> Numeric Range**
Then displaying it with a dropdown slicer.

Secondly, to display the selected number from dropdown within the text under the header, I have created a new measure namely "Title Top Customer" with below DAX code.

Lastly, I created another measure namely "Dynamic Customers Chart" to display the revenue generated by Top N customers with below DAX code. Where N corresponds to the number selected from dropdown.

#### Part 3:

This part of the Dashboard corresponds to the Fourth objective of the project.

Inorder to calculate the percentage revenues, first a measure of total revenue must be calculated as such.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d9e4bf-c3a0-4cb8-83d0-2cbf127cedfb)

Then, new measures for Revenues of Customers Without Children and Customers With Children are created as below respectively.

Lastly, the percentage measures are created for each customer category and displayed as donut charts and cards in the center using below DAX codes.

Now, Here comes the most important part of the project. i.e. to create a **Dynamic Caption** below the donut charts for each category displayed as a card. Which updates itself automatically if any changes is made via filters. For which I have written below DAX code respectively for each category. I have to display it in chunks since the code is very long.

Similarly Caption for Customers With Children is created.

#### Part 4:

This gives answere to the 5th Objective of the Project.

Here inorder to fulfill the task. First, a new column must be created to categorize the customers by age. Below is the DAX code to accomplish this task.

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592f7b28-8500-4750-a233-d0b079d6bd50)

Now that we have created this new column. We can display the revenue generated by each age category using Total revenue measure (which was previously created) and above newly created column with a column chart.

Hmmm, so far so good.

Now that we have created the bar chart, it definatly needs a good dynamic caption which must change if any filter is altered on the dashboard accordingly. so how to do it? Here is the DAX code.

Thanks, that you followed this much.

Now its time to look at the fifth part of the dashboard.

#### Part 5:

Here the Sixth Objective of the Project is put forward. Where the revenue of 3 customer categories are compared. 

To get the job done, we have to categorize the customers by creating a new column in the DimCustomer Table with below DAX code.
